# **Pipeline Overview**

This bioinformatics pipeline performs comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viral sequencing data using the paired-end Illumina reads from sample ERR5743893 (ENA accession). 
The workflow maps these reads against the reference genome MN908947.3 (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, ~30kb) to identify genomic variants and assess sequencing quality.​

## **Scientific Context**

**Sample Origin:** ERR5743893 represents real-world clinical or surveillance sequencing data from the European Nucleotide Archive, typical of early COVID-19 genomic surveillance efforts.

**Reference Genome:** MN908947.3 is the original Wuhan strain sequence, serving as the baseline for variant detection across global SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

## **Analysis Goals:**

1. Evaluate raw read quality (FastQC)

2. Quantify alignment coverage and mapping rates (BWA + samtools)

3. Discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) relative to the reference (Freebayes)​

## **Pipeline Workflow Summary**

Raw FASTQ → Quality Control → Read Alignment → BAM Processing → Variant Calling → VCF Output

## **Key Metrics Generated:**

**FastQC reports:** Per-base quality scores, adapter content, duplication levels

**Alignment statistics:** Mapping rate, coverage depth across the ~30kb genome

**Variant file:** High-confidence SNPs/indels with quality scores and allele frequencies​
